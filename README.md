To run
-----------
`node server.js`

You will need to have node installed, and likely npm (node package manager) as well to install the node_modules.

There will be conflicts if you have something else running on port 3000 of you computer. Once the server is running, access it by going to localhost:3000 (port 3000 of your localhost).
